# RAIL Face Detector Metapackage

This repository contains nodes and packages that we use for face detection. All methods of face detection publish faces either in the message formats defined in [`rail_face_detection_msgs`](rail_face_detection_msgs/), or as [people_msgs/PositionMeasurementArray](http://wiki.ros.org/people_msgs).

**TODO**: Integrate the different nodes that publish different message types into a single output from this set of packages.
